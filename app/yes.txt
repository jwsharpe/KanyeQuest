Hi <first name>,

Thank you for accepting my connection request.

I’m thinking of applying to this position I found on your website: https://www.paperlesspost.com/about/jobs/?gh_jid=1709559

I am a recent mathematics and computer science graduate and am about to release my first android app!

I was wondering, would I be qualified enough for this position? If not, is there anything I can do to better prepare myself?

Thanks!
James
